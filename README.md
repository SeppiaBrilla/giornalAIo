# GiornalAIo
A simple project that uses a local mistral 7b model to generate news articles starting from the [ANSA's](https://www.ansa.it/) ones. It is meant to show the capabilities of local LLMS model even without fine tuning nor particular prompt ingeneering. You can find the articles under the corresponding git hub pages [link](https://seppiabrilla.github.io/giornalAIo/).

## How to run
To run the project locally you need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed with the mistral model. Simply clone the repository, verify to have the necessary libaries installed and run the creator script.
