            <p>
On January 18th, Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis spoke at a conference in Davos about the state of the EU's budgetary process for 2024. During his speech, he mentioned that several member states, including Italy, were not following the recommendations of the European Council regarding their budget plans.

The Commission has expressed concerns about Italy's budgetary situation, specifically regarding the growth in its aggregate primary budget deficit net. While Italy is currently meeting one of the EU's fundamental budget recommendations for 2024, the Commission believes that this growth is not fully aligned with the recommendation due to factors such as the Superbonus program and changes in tax credits for energy-efficient residential buildings.

As a result, the Commission has invited Italy to take corrective measures to ensure that its budget policy for 2024 is in line with EU recommendations. Similarly, the Commission has urged Germany to reduce its support for renewable energy as soon as possible in order to align its policy with EU guidelines.

While Italy has not yet responded to these calls, Vice President Dombrovskis has stated that he will remain in contact with the government and work with them to find a solution. The Commission's focus on budgetary issues in Europe reflects its ongoing efforts to ensure that member states maintain fiscal discipline and adhere to EU guidelines.</p>

                <p>The aging population is a significant factor that has a profound impact on the economy. With more people retiring and living longer, there are increased demands on healthcare and social security systems.

                <h3>4. Combining Immunotherapy and Chemioembolization Improves Outcome for Patients with Liver Cancer</h3>
                <p>
In this article, we explore the use of immunotherapy and chemioembolization in the treatment of liver cancer. These two therapies work together to improve outcomes for patients by attacking cancer cells from different angles. Immunotherapy boosts the immune system's ability to fight cancer, while chemioembolization blocks blood flow to tumors, effectively starving them of nutrients and oxygen. By combining these two treatments, doctors can increase the effectiveness of treatment and reduce side effects for patients. This research shows promising results for patients with liver cancer and highlights the potential for future advancements in cancer treatment.</p>
