Italy's public debt is one of the largest in the world, and it has been a major concern for policymakers for years. In order to address this issue, experts have proposed a comprehensive fiscal and spending reform agenda. The plan includes measures such as reducing government expenditure, increasing revenue, and restructuring debt.
