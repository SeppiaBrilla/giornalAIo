            <p>
A massive fire broke out Monday morning inside the Planet Farms facility in Cavenago (Monza), an agricultural vertical farming company. The smoke column that rose as a result of the fire can be seen from several kilometers away, even from the A4 motorway, which is located less than a kilometer from the factory. As of now, there are no reported injuries or poisoning.

Firefighters are currently working on the scene, with some teams coming from Milan. Cavenago Mayor Monica Buzzini issued an alert on social media channels to inform residents to close their windows. The Arpa will also be involved in the incident investigation.

The cause of the fire is not yet known, but it is clear that the situation has caused concern among local residents and those traveling on the A4 motorway. It is hoped that the fire can be contained quickly and without any further complications.</p>
