In Milan, the first hearing for Alessandro Impagnatiello, a 30-year-old former barman accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend Giulia Tramontano, began. The trial is taking place in the courtroom of the First Court of Assise. The courtroom is filled with curious onlookers and journalists as the proceedings continue.

During the hearing, the defendant's sister Chiara spoke out and demanded justice for her sister's murder. Chiara also criticized the ex-barman and accused him of not taking responsibility for his actions.

In addition to Chiara's testimony, the court heard audio recordings from Giulia's phone in which she expressed her intention to start a new life with her baby. The court also presented evidence of a video from a party that Giulia attended before her murder, during which Impagnatiello was present as well.

The prosecution claims that Impagnatiello murdered Giulia because he was jealous and angry at her for ending their relationship. The defense argues that the murder was committed in a fit of rage after a heated argument with Giulia.

As the trial continues, there will be more evidence presented to determine whether Impagnatiello is guilty of murdering his girlfriend. The fate of the accused will depend on the strength of the evidence and the testimony of witnesses.</p>
