            <p>
The Italian steel industry is facing a major challenge with the ongoing crisis at the former Ilva steel mill in Taranto. The association Aigi, which represents about 80% of the companies that work with Ilva, has called for government intervention to ensure the payment of outstanding debts and prevent the closure of the plant.

On Wednesday, a corteo consisting of workers and vehicles departed from the plant's C loop and marched towards the city, causing temporary roadblocks and traffic slowdowns on the state highways 106 Ionica and Appia. The protest was sparked despite the Minister of Industry and Made in Italy Adolfo Urso having convened a videoconference with the associations representing Ilva's suppliers and industry partners on Tuesday to discuss the situation and possible solutions.

Aigi is demanding the payment of all invoices due by December 31, 2023, and is calling for a "credible industrial plan" that guarantees continuity in production. The protest was held despite the Italian government's intention to appoint a temporary commissioner to resolve the Ilva crisis and find new partners for the plant's operation.

The Italian Senate will begin examining the decree on Ilva, which was published in Gazzetta Ufficiale on Wednesday. The decree strengthens existing measures to protect the continuity of production and employment at struggling companies, including Ilva, and provides for cash transfers during any potential amministrazione straordinaria.

The European Union is also weighing in on the Ilva crisis, with the Commission's spokesperson stating that Italy must decide whether a specific measure involves state aid and therefore must be notified to the Commission for preventive evaluation of any concession of aid.

In response to this challenge, the Italian steel industry is calling for greater support from the government and the international community to ensure the survival of Ilva and maintain the country's strategic position in the global steel market.</p>

                <p>
In the aftermath of the recent crisis at Ilva Steel, MEP Ana Gomes has called for government intervention to ensure that the workers' rights and livelihoods are protected. The steel manufacturer, which was acquired by Italian firm ArcelorMittal in 2014, has been plagued with issues including unpaid wages, layoffs, and job insecurity, leaving many employees struggling to make ends meet. With the European Parliament set to vote on a resolution condemning the situation at Ilva Steel, Gomes has emphasized the need for immediate action from the Portuguese government to safeguard workers' rights and prevent further damage to the industry as a whole.</p>

                <p>
The European Union (EU) is closely monitoring the ongoing crisis at Ilva, an Italian steel company. As a result, the EU has demanded that Italy inform the Commission of any state aid provided to the struggling company. The move is intended to ensure transparency and prevent any potential unfair competition with other companies in the industry. The Ilva crisis has had significant economic implications for Italy, and the EU's intervention could help mitigate some of the negative effects.</p>
