As the Arctic air continues to sweep across Europe, Italy is no exception. According to Antonio Sanò, from the website www.iLMeteo.it, the cold air will reach our country through two channels: the Porta della Bora in the Alps Giulie and the Rodano in southern France.

As the Bora approaches, the weather in Italy will deteriorate rapidly. The cold front from the north-east will bring heavy rain to Lombardy, Marche, Umbria, and Tuscany. Meanwhile, a warm front from the west will bring a cyclone to the Balearic Islands, which will trigger a low-pressure system that will reach Sicily and southern Italy with snow and heavy rainfall.

Today, rain is falling on the north-east of Italy, while Marche, Umbria, Tuscany, and Lombardy are already experiencing snowfall. Due to the sudden drop in temperatures, there is a possibility that snow will reach as far as Milano. The situation is particularly precarious on the Balearic Islands, where a cyclone is causing heavy rainfall and potentially dangerous conditions.

Tomorrow, the high-pressure system will return to the north of Italy, bringing with it strong winds from the Arctic air mass. The storm will then move southwards, bringing snow and sleet to the mountains, and even to lower ground in some areas. There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in Marche, Molise, Campania, and Calabria, as well as a chance of hailstorms in Puglia.

On Sunday, the low-pressure system will move away, but not before leaving some residual snow and sleet on the ground. The temperatures will continue to drop, with temperatures of up to -25°C possible in the Alps. In addition, the arrival of an anti-cyclone from Africa is expected in the coming days, which will bring a renewed cold wave to Italy.

In conclusion, it is important for Italians to be aware of the changing weather conditions and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families during this time of extreme cold.</p>

                <p>

                <h3>2. Fighting for Compassionate Care: Elly Schleins Speech on Assisted Suicide and Autonomy in Italy.</h3>
                <p>
In Italy, a battle for compassionate care and the right to assisted suicide is being fought. During her speech at a conference on euthanasia, Elly Schleins, a prominent human rights activist and lawyer, argued for greater autonomy in end-of-life decision making. She highlighted the importance of respecting individual choices and providing compassionate care, rather than imposing strict moral or religious beliefs.

Schleins pointed out that Italy's current laws, which prohibit assisted suicide and euthanasia, can lead to unnecessary suffering for those who are terminally ill. She called on lawmakers to reconsider these laws in light of recent developments in other countries where assisted suicide has been legalized with strict regulations in place.

The conference attendees agreed that more must be done to ensure that all individuals have access to compassionate care at the end of their lives, regardless of their circumstances. They emphasized the need for greater education and awareness on euthanasia and assisted suicide, as well as stronger protections for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and disabled.</p>

                <p>
In a recent study, researchers found that combining immunotherapy and chemioembolization improved outcomes for patients with liver cancer. Immunotherapy helps the immune system fight against cancer cells, while chemioembolization blocks off blood flow to tumors, making it harder for them to grow. By using both treatments together, doctors were able to shrink tumors and increase survival rates in patients with liver cancer.</p>

                <h3>4. San Marino Bans Smartphones in Schools to Promote Complete Education and Moral Formation</h3>
                <p>
San Marino has recently banned smartphones in schools to promote complete education and moral formation. This decision was made in response to concerns about the negative impact of smartphone usage on students' academic performance, mental health, and social skills. The government believes that by limiting access to technology, students will have more time for learning and developing important life skills. In addition, the ban aims to protect students from cyberbullying and other forms of online harassment.</p>
