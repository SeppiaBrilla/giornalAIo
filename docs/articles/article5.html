The Italian government is reportedly considering privatizing a portion of Eni, the country's largest oil and gas company. According to sources close to the matter, the government is looking at selling up to 4% of its stake in Eni, which currently holds a controlling 32.4% stake through a combination of direct ownership and holdings via Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. The move could potentially help the government reduce its debt, with an estimated income of around €2 billion from the sale of shares.

The news comes as part of the Italian government's ambitious plan to sell off state-owned assets to private companies in a bid to boost economic growth and create jobs. The plan, which has been met with mixed reactions from Italian politicians and business leaders, includes the privatization of several key industries, including energy, transportation, and defense.

Eni has already begun implementing its own buyback program, with plans to repurchase up to €2.2 billion worth of shares by April 2024. Once this process is complete, the government could potentially sell off a portion of its stake in Eni, allowing it to further reduce its debt and free up resources for other areas of investment.

The move has been met with some resistance from labor unions and political opponents, who fear that privatization could lead to job losses and weaker protections for workers. However, supporters of the plan argue that it is necessary to attract foreign investment and modernize Italy's aging infrastructure.

In other news, the Italian government has announced plans to sell off a portion of its stake in Ilva, a struggling steel mill in southern Italy, to raise funds for the company's restructuring. The move is seen as a key part of the government's efforts to revive the country's flagging economy and create new jobs.</p>

                <p>
The Italian government is considering privatizing a portion of Eni, the state-owned oil and gas company, as part of an effort to reduce debt and boost economic growth. The proposed plan would see the sale of up to 20% of the company to private investors, generating revenue for the government while also allowing Eni to continue its operations in the competitive energy market. While the move has been met with some opposition from labor unions and environmental groups, the Italian government believes that privatization is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the country's largest state-owned enterprise.</p>
