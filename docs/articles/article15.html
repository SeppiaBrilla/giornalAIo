Axiom Space has announced the launch of its mission, Ax-3, scheduled for 22:49 Italian time today. The company made the announcement on its website, referencing a post by SpaceX that "all systems are in good condition in view of the launch of Ax-3" and that meteorological predictions give an 80% chance of successful launch.

The mission will be piloted by Italian colonel Walter Villadei of the Aeronautica Militare Italiana, who is joined on board by Marcus Wandt, a member of the new class of astronauts from the European Space Agency, and Alper Gezeravci, the first Turkish astronaut. The mission commander is Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space.

The launch will take place at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Falcon 9, the rocket built by SpaceX, will be used to carry the Ax-3 mission into orbit. This marks the company's first launch since the successful landing of the Starship prototype in December.

Axiom Space has been developing and testing its space tourism business model for several years, with plans to send paying customers to the International Space Station. However, this first mission will be purely scientific, with the aim of studying the effects of microgravity on human cells and tissues.</p>
