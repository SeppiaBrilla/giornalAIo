According to Italian political leader Matteo Salvini, if a mayor or governor has worked well, they should be considered for re-election. However, he emphasized that the unity of the center-right coalition is the top priority, and personal or party logics must come second. He stated this during an interview in Benevento on the topic of the candidate for the regional elections in Sardegna.

The vicesegretario of the Lega, Andrea Crippa, also commented on the issue of the candidate for the center-right in Sardegna. He said that the question must be defined, but he believes that in the end, it will be Truzzu.

It's worth noting that Crippa mentioned the Lega's efforts to unite the center-right coalition in Sardegna and how it is important for them to continue believing in the Solinas government. He also pointed out that a third party must make an effort if they want to be considered as a viable option for the regional elections in Sardegna.

The Lega's position on this issue was echoed by Crippa, who mentioned that he understands FdI's stance on the candidate for the regional elections in Sicily and that they believe that their candidate is better suited to lead the region. He also pointed out that the Lega in Sardegna has made an effort to bring the center-right together and that it is important for them to continue doing so in order to maintain a united front.</p>
