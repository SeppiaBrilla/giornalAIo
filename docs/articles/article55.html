The use of immunotherapy in combination with chemioembolization has been shown to significantly improve the outcome for patients with liver cancer who are not eligible for surgery. In a study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, Riccardo Lencioni, professor of diagnostic imaging at the University of Pisa, reported that adding durvalumab to the standard of care chemioembolization doubled the time to progression in patients with liver cancer.

Approximately 20-30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the most common type of liver cancer in Italy and affects approximately 12,200 people each year, are eligible for chemioembolization transarteriosa, a procedure that blocks blood flow to the tumor and allows the administration of chemotherapy or radiation therapy directly to the liver. However, the majority of patients who undergo chemioembolization go on to experience progression of the disease or a recurrence within a year.

The study compared the efficacy of the current standard of care with a new regime that included durvalumab in addition to chemioembolization transarteriosa, followed by durvalumab with or without bevacizumab. The results showed that the new regime resulted in a significant reduction in progression or death and increased the time to progression of the disease by 15 months compared to the current standard of care, which was only 8.2 months.

"The study provides strong evidence for the importance of combining immunotherapy with chemioembolization when the tumor is confined to the liver and there is no compromise in liver function," said Vincenzo Mazzaferro, director of chirurgical oncology (epato-gastro-pancreatic) at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan. "Some of these patients may even achieve tumor responses that are compatible with curative treatments such as liver resection or transplantation."</p>

Riccardo Lencioni, a professor of diagnostic imaging at the University of Pisa, has announced that adding durvalumab to standard chemioembolization doubles the time to progression in patients with liver cancer. This study provides new hope for those battling this aggressive form of cancer, as it suggests that combining different treatments may be more effective than using only one.</p>
