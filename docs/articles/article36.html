            <p>
The Prosecutor's Office of Rome has closed its investigation into Aurelio De Laurentiis, the president of Napoli, for the allegation of false accounting. The investigation was launched following the transmission of documents from Napoli related to the purchase of Victor Osimhen from Lille in 2020.

The investigation involved both the President De Laurentiis and Calcio Napoli. An announcement of the closure of the investigation was made, which also included the other indicted individuals, such as members of the board of directors who were in office at the time of the alleged events.

According to Fabio Fulgeri, the lawyer representing De Laurentiis in this investigation, the allegation of false accounting is based on an initial hypothesis that suggests the intention to defraud the tax authorities. However, this hypothesis has been excluded by magistrates in Naples as there is no evidence of any such attempt.

Therefore, while the investigation remains open, it is not a formal charge, and the indicted individuals can now access the documents to defend themselves before the prosecutor's office. It is expected that the documents will be made available to the public in the coming week, and then the lawyers of the accused will present their arguments before the court.

Fulgeri also noted that there is no need for a profit motive, as the Prosecutor's Office of Naples has already excluded any such benefits for Napoli. It remains to be seen what evidence the prosecutor's office is relying on to maintain this investigation.</p>
