A Bangkok, Thailandia, the Thai justice system has sentenced a man to 50 years in prison for insulting the royal family. This is the most severe sentence ever handed down for this type of crime. According to a group of human rights lawyers, judges have increased the sentence by 22 years from the original ruling of the Chiang Rai tribunal.

The convicted man, 30-year-old Mongkol Thirakot, owns an online clothing store and was found guilty of 11 defamatory posts about the king and his family on Facebook. He is appealing to the Supreme Court. This sentence surpasses the previous record of a 43-year prison term handed down in January 2021 against a woman for posting hostile messages about the monarchy on social media.

The Thai lawyers for human rights (Tlhr) have expressed concern that this verdict sends a chilling message to free speech advocates. They argue that Thailand's judiciary has become increasingly repressive under the leadership of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who has tightened his grip on power since he ascended to the throne in 2016.

The group called for an end to this trend and urged the international community to hold Thailand accountable for its human rights record. They also called on the government to reform its laws to protect free speech while ensuring that it does not incite violence or harm to others.

It is worth noting that lese-majeste, or insulting the monarchy, is a highly sensitive issue in Thailand, and even minor infractions can lead to severe consequences, including long prison sentences and fines. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of individuals being arrested and sentenced for speaking out against the royal family.

In conclusion, the sentence handed down to Mongkol Thirakot highlights the ongoing problem of freedom of expression in Thailand. The Tlhr has called on the international community to hold the country accountable and demand that its government respects human rights and freedoms.</p>

                <p>
In a recent decision, the Italian court upheld the right of workers to receive payment for unused vacation days upon resignation. This ruling, which was based on the country's labor laws, clarified that employees are entitled to this compensation as long as they have provided proper notice and have not exceeded their statutory limit of unused vacation time.
