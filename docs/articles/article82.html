Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been diagnosed with cancer for the second time in just six months. The news was announced yesterday by sources close to the royal family.

Fergie, as she is famously known, turned 64 years old on Sunday. Six months ago, she underwent a mastectomy due to breast cancer. More recently, her dermatologist recommended the removal of several moles to be cautiously monitored before any reconstructive surgery could be performed. One of these moles was found to be a malignant melanoma on her skin.

This latest announcement marks the third health concern involving members or ex-members of the British royal family in just a few days. Earlier this week, it was reported that the Princess of Wales, Kate, had undergone an operation on her stomach. Additionally, the 75-year-old king, Charles, is expected to have an intervention on his prostate soon for a condition that has been described as "benign."

Despite divorcing from Andrew years ago and not being invited to the coronation of Charles and Camilla, Fergie remains a close friend with her ex-husband. She resides with him at Windsor, but is no longer considered a member of the Royal Family in its strictest sense.

However, she was able to attend the royal family's Christmas service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Windsor last year for the first time in over three decades. It remains to be seen how Fergie will navigate this latest health challenge and what impact it may have on her relationship with the royal family moving forward.</p>
