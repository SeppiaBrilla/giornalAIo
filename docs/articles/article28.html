This shift in demographics can have a significant impact on labor markets, social security systems, healthcare costs, and overall economic growth. Governments must carefully plan policies to address these issues and ensure that their aging populations remain economically active and contribute to society.</p>

                <p>
In a passionate speech at the World Parliamentary Forum on Democracy in Rome, Italy, Elly Schleins, the founder of the Italian association "Doctors for Dignity," called for greater compassion and autonomy for those seeking assisted suicide.
