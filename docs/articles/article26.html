In a rapidly changing demographic landscape, the concepts of protection, welfare, and insurance coverage are being redefined. This is the focus of the first event in the new series "Parliamo di protezione con..." hosted by Area X, a pioneering experimental space launched by Intesa Sanpaolo Assicura to promote the culture of protection. The event, which takes place on January 18th at 11am on Areax.info and ANSA.it, promises an engaging dialogue about the role of insurance in a demographic context that is evolving rapidly.

Joining the discussion will be Federico Quaranta, a renowned radio and television host, as well as Alessandro Scarf√≤, director general of Intesa Sanpaolo Assicura, Tiziana Lamberti, executive director of Sales & Marketing for Wealth Management & Protection at Intesa Sanpaolo, and Alessandro Rosina, professor of Demography and Social Statistics at the Catholic University.

During the event, the panelists will explore how insurance can play a critical role in addressing emerging challenges in areas such as denatality, increased longevity, and delayed independence among young people. This dialogue is an opportunity for viewers to gain valuable insights into how insurance coverage can be tailored to meet the changing needs of individuals and society as a whole.

If you want to catch this engaging event live, mark your calendars and tune in to Areax.info or ANSA.it on January 18th at 11am. Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn more about the role of insurance in shaping our future!</p>
