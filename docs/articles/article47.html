Prince Harry, the second eldest son of King Charles III, and Prince Andrew, the firstborn brother of the king, are no longer active members of the House of Windsor's Council of State. However, they remain on paper as members of the organization that is tasked with providing a regal presence in the absence of the monarch.

According to reports from The Times, this development comes after a recent medical procedure to correct an enlarged prostate was confirmed for King Charles III, who will undergo the operation next week. It is reported that the procedure is not expected to pose any risks to the king's health and that it will not require formal temporary succession from the throne.

The decision to exclude Harry and Andrew from the Council of State has sparked questions about who will be present at official events in their absence. However, according to reports from Buckingham Palace, the active members of the council include Queen Camilla, the four princes over 21 years old in line for the throne (Prince William, his brother Harry, Prince Andrew, and Princess Beatrice), as well as Princess Anne and Prince Edward, who were co-opted by King Charles III.

It is important to note that a recent piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament assigns active members to the Council of State, which means that Harry and Andrew are excluded from this role at present. However, they retain their formal title as councillors of state.

This development may limit the operational capabilities of the House of Windsor, with both Prince William and Prince Andrew unavailable to perform official duties in the coming weeks. The delfin will be unable to fulfill his usual public engagements due to his wife's upcoming surgery and subsequent convalescence period, which is expected to last at least three months.

Overall, this development highlights the importance of a well-functioning monarchy and the need for effective succession planning in the face of unforeseen circumstances.</p>

                <p>

The decision was made by the king's advisors in order to maintain a sense of impartiality and avoid any potential conflicts of interest. It is important to note that this is not an unusual occurrence, as members of the royal family are often excluded from certain official duties during times of medical treatment or other personal matters.</p>

                <h3>4. Combining Immunotherapy and Chemioembolization Improves Outcome for Patients with Liver Cancer</h3>
                <p>
Immunotherapy and chemioembolization may be a promising combination for patients with liver cancer, according to new research. A recent study showed that combining these two treatments can lead to better outcomes for patients, including improved survival rates and reduced side effects. Immunotherapy helps to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells, while chemioembolization involves blocking blood vessels to the tumor site with a substance that can shrink or destroy the cancer. Together, these therapies may provide a more effective and targeted approach to treating liver cancer.</p>
