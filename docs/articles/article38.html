Benyamin Netanyahu's reign as leader of the Likud party is coming to an end, with sources within the party saying that there are growing doubts about his ability to fulfill his promises to destroy Hamas and release all prisoners. The Jerusalem Post reports that anonymous sources within the party say that these doubts have been exacerbated by recent events, such as the Gaza Strip protests in October. According to polls, the Likud is expected to lose several seats in the upcoming election, with the centrist party of Benny Gantz currently leading in the polls. This means that Netanyahu may not be able to retain his leadership within the Likud or even maintain his current position as Prime Minister of Israel.

Rumors are swirling about potential successors to Netanyahu within the Likud party, including Yoav Gallant and Nir Barkat. The Jerusalem Post reports that Gallant is currently the Minister of Defense and Katz is the Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Barkat is the head of the Ministry of Economy. Other names being discussed include Yuli Edelstein, who is the current President of the Constitutional Commission.

In addition to these rumors, new polls have shown that Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist party, is currently leading Netanyahu in the polls. This means that Gantz may be poised to take over as Prime Minister if Netanyahu is unable to maintain his leadership within the Likud party.

Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains tense, with Israeli forces conducting a raid on the Strip earlier this month, resulting in at least 12 deaths. The raid was condemned by both Israelis and Palestinians, who continue to engage in violence and protests against each other.

Overall, it looks like Netanyahu's reign as leader of the Likud party may be coming to an end soon. With new leadership on the horizon and tensions continuing to escalate on the ground in Gaza, the future of Israel remains uncertain.</p>

                <h3>4. Combining Immunotherapy and Chemioembolization Improves Outcome for Patients with Liver Cancer</h3>
                <p>
A recent study has shown that combining immunotherapy and chemioembolization can improve outcomes for patients with liver cancer. The study found that this combination therapy was more effective at shrinking tumors and extending survival time than either treatment alone. Immunotherapy boosts the immune system to fight cancer cells, while chemioembolization blocks blood flow to the tumor site, preventing it from receiving nutrients and growing. By combining these treatments, doctors can attack the tumor from multiple angles, increasing the likelihood of success.</p>

                <p>
San Marino has recently banned the use of smartphones in schools as part of an effort to promote complete education and moral formation among students. The decision was made after a survey revealed that many students were using their phones during class, leading to distractions and reduced productivity. The ban applies to all devices with internet access and is intended to help students focus on their studies and develop healthy habits. Supporters of the ban argue that it will also help protect young people from cyberbullying and other online threats.</p>
