ANSA Expands International Collaborations with New Partnership with Ethiopian News Agency (ENA)

Italian news agency ANSA is expanding its international collaborations by signing a new partnership agreement with the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The partnership, which aims to strengthen ties between Italy and Etiopia, includes the exchange of content and the possibility of developing joint commercial offers to support communication for institutions and businesses in both countries.

The deal was signed in a virtual ceremony attended by Ambassador Agostino Palese, who affirmed that his embassy in Addis Ababa is working every day to strengthen relations between Italy and Etiopia, believing in the strategic partnership between the two countries. The ambassador expressed satisfaction that the partnership between ANSA and ENA marks an important step towards bringing the two peoples closer together.

ENA's administrator delegato, Seife Deribe, echoed this sentiment, stating that the deal strengthens ties between Italy and Etiopia by bringing together two of the oldest and largest news agencies in their respective countries. Both ANSA and ENA will be able to meet the information needs of their respective countries and regions.

Stefano De Alessandri, ANSA's administrator delegato, said that this partnership will enable ANSA to improve its coverage of events in Ethiopia, while also allowing ENA to provide more news about Italy to readers in Ethiopia. The first step in the partnership will involve joint projects aimed at supporting communication for aziende and istituzioni in both countries.
