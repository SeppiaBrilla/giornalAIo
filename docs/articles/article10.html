The Pakistan Government has responded to the Iranian attacks on its territory by repaying them with the same currency. The Pakistani military launched airstrikes in the city of Saravan in Baluchistan, near the border between the two countries, targeting groups they claim are anti-Pakistani militants. These attacks occurred just two days after Iran accused Pakistan of hosting separatist Baluchi groups in its territory.

The Pakistani government has been quick to condemn the attack on Iran and has called for a dialogue with Tehran to resolve the issue peacefully. However, Iran has responded by calling for an explanation from Pakistan's ambassador to Tehran after two civilians were killed in a strike on a group known as Jaish al-Adl, which is considered a terrorist organization by many countries including Pakistan and Iran.

The conflict between Pakistan and Iran has been longstanding, with both countries accusing each other of harboring separatist groups along their shared border. While this is not the first time such attacks have occurred, they have increased tensions between the two nations.

In response to the situation, the US government has condemned the attacks on Iran and expressed its support for Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism. UAE and Turkey have also expressed concern over the escalation of tensions and urged both countries to engage in dialogue. Russia has invited both countries to exercise moderation and has offered to act as a mediator.

Meanwhile, the conflict between Israel and Iran continues to simmer, with the former accusing the latter of supporting terrorist groups in Yemen, Lebanon, and Gaza through its proxies the Houthi and Hezbollah respectively. This has led to increased tension between Israel and Iran and their respective allies.

The US government has stepped up its military operations against Iranian-backed militants in Yemen, launching airstrikes on missile facilities. The Pentagon claims that these attacks were carried out in response to the Houthi's recent attacks on US warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

The escalation of tensions between Pakistan and Iran has added another layer of complexity to an already volatile situation in the Middle East. While both countries have condemned the attacks, it remains to be seen whether they can resolve their differences peacefully or if the conflict will continue to simmer.</p>
