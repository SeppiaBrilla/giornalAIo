The Italian government's right-wing wing has long been preoccupied with occupying the throne. This was recently illustrated by the appointment of Luca De Fusco as director general of the Teatro di Roma, a decision made by the board of directors (Cda) of the Fondazione, despite the absence of key stakeholders such as the president, Francesco Siciliano, and the consigliera indicated by the municipality, Natalia Di Iorio.

The appointment of De Fusco has been met with criticism from the opposition, who have branded it a "blitz" of the government's right-wing wing on culture. However, the minister of culture, Gennaro Sangiuliano, has defended the appointment as a meritorious decision based on the candidate's experience and qualifications. He also argued that it was necessary to allow non-roman politicians to express themselves in the cultural sector, which is traditionally dominated by the city of Rome.

The case has now been taken up in parliament, with an interrogation urgente being announced against the minister of culture. The mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, has also expressed his opposition to the appointment, indicating that he will impugn the deliberation.

Despite the controversy surrounding the appointment, Sangiuliano has defended the process used to select the candidates for the role, arguing that it was conducted in an external committee and not by the Cda alone. He also argued that the candidate's qualifications were more important than their political affiliation.

The opposition, however, has accused Sangiuliano of using the appointment as a means to advance his own agenda and suppress dissenting voices. They have called for a review of the process and an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the appointment.

The case has also sparked debate on the role of cultural institutions in Italy's political landscape. Some argue that these institutions should remain politically neutral, while others believe that they have a role to play in shaping public opinion and promoting cultural diversity.

As the controversy continues, it remains to be seen how the government will respond to the criticism and what impact this appointment will have on Italy's cultural landscape.</p>
