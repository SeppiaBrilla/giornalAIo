In recent years, there has been a lot of debate about the speed limit in urban areas. One particular issue that has arisen is the 30 km/h speed limit in Bologna, Italy. Some critics argue that this speed limit is not a rational choice because it may not be enough to address the problems faced by citizens, particularly workers, while still ensuring road safety.

In response to these criticisms, the mayor of Bologna, Matteo Lepore, has accused the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport (MIT) of spreading fake news about the speed limit in the city. According to Lepore, there are many fake news stories circulating on social media that have been amplified by the MIT. He argues that these false information can create fear among citizens and undermine the efforts of the local government to improve road safety.

The MIT has responded by stating that it is prepared to initiate an immediate confrontation with the Bolognese government to find alternative solutions that do not risk causing forced migrations or flight before being proven wrong, as happened in Milano regarding the obligation for heavy vehicles to have blind spots angle devices. The MIT reiterates its commitment to ensuring road safety, which remains one of its top priorities.

The mayor of Bologna, Matteo Lepore, has responded by stating that fake news is also spread by politicians such as the MIT, and that his government's priority is to make courageous decisions, even if it means risking personal consequences. He reiterates that he will always tell the truth without using fake news to further political goals.

The debate over the 30 km/h speed limit in Bologna has also attracted attention from other politicians and commentators. Some have praised the city's efforts to improve road safety, while others have criticized the decision as too draconian. In any case, it is clear that this issue will continue to be a topic of discussion for some time to come.</p>
