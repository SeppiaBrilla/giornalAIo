Italian politicians have been caught up in a scandal involving the theft of a painting from an Italian museum. The M5S party, which represents a large portion of the population, has presented a motion against the undersecretary of culture Vittorio Sgarbi, who is under investigation for his involvement in the theft of the painting. However, Sgarbi was not present in the chamber during the discussion of the motion, and the other undersecretary of culture, Gianmarco Mazzi, answered on his behalf.

Sgarbi has been accused of covering up the theft by using anonymous letters to intimidate the witnesses and obstruct the investigation. This behavior is condemned by many as being unethical and immoral, but Sgarbi argues that he is simply a victim of political attacks. The M5S party, on the other hand, argues that Sgarbi's behavior is part of a larger problem in Italian politics where the ruling party uses its power to control cultural institutions for their own gain.

The debate continues as many politicians from different parties weigh in on the issue, with some condemning Sgarbi's actions while others defend him. The public remains divided and uncertain about the future of the Italian art world and the integrity of its institutions.</p>
