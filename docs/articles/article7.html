Le polemiche politiche e i pregiudizi ideologici sono estranei alle forze armate. Non è un caso che, nel calendario, chi fu decorato prima dell'armistizio ricevette un'onorificenza ancora più importante e prestigiosa per quanto fatto dopo l'8 settembre; gli ideali e i valori che li animarono erano gli stessi: quelli del giuramento alla Patria e alle istituzioni. Questo è lo spirito del CalendEsercito 2024! - conclude la nota -. Le polemiche politiche e i pregiudizi ideologici sono estranei alle forze armate.

                <h3>1. Climate Change Impacts Butterfly Spotted Patterns and Migration</h3>
                <p>
Butterflies, like many other species, are affected by climate change. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter the timing of their life cycles, affecting their ability to migrate and find food sources. This disruption can have significant impacts on butterfly populations, with some species experiencing declines and even extinction. As such, it is important to continue monitoring and studying the effects of climate change on butterflies and other species to better understand and mitigate its impact.</p>

                <h3>5. New Revelations Suggest Animals-to-Humans Transmission of Covid-19</h3>
                <p>
Recent studies have hinted at the possibility that Covid-19 may have been transmitted from animals to humans, with evidence suggesting that certain species may be responsible for its spread. This includes bats, which are believed to have carried the virus prior to it reaching humans in Wuhan, China. Additionally, other mammals such as pangolins and tigers have also been linked to the virus's transmission. As further investigations continue, more information may be uncovered about the origins of the pandemic and how it spread from animal to human populations.</p>
