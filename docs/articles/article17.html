Israel is at war with Hamas and it's a fight for the freedom of the world. President Isaac Herzog has made this clear in a speech he gave at Davos, warning that there are no guarantees of safety for Israeli citizens if terrorism continues to exist in Gaza. The focus should be on eliminating terrorism, according to Herzog. He also emphasized that Israel wants to live in peace and have good relations with Palestine. However, he said that the tragedy in Gaza is un unfortunate reality, but it does not change the fact that Israel has a right to defend itself from terrorist attacks.

The possibility of creating an independent Palestinian state is another topic of discussion, and the United States is involved. The premier, Benyamin Netanyahu, has rejected a proposal by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu argues that this would lead to a repetition of the conflict and the creation of another terror-sponsoring state. He believes that the war against Hamas will continue until all goals are achieved, including the release of Israeli prisoners and the destruction of Hamas's infrastructure.

The ongoing conflict in Gaza has already resulted in more than 24,000 deaths, with many civilians among them. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has reported that 151 of its employees have been killed since the conflict began. In addition to the violence in Gaza, there is also tension in Libya, where rockets from Hezbollah continue to strike Israel.

Despite these challenges, the Israeli government remains committed to maintaining security and protecting its citizens. The Minister of Defense, Yair Gallant, has warned that Israel must prepare for a potential escalation of the conflict and ensure that it is well-equipped to defend itself against any threat.

In conclusion, the war between Israel and Hamas is a fight for freedom and the protection of Israeli citizens. While the world continues to support peace efforts, Israel remains committed to eliminating terrorism and ensuring its own security.</p>
