Italian politician Gennaro Sangiuliano has requested an intervention at the head of RAI, Giovanni Anversa, for the imitation that Virginia Raffaele did of Beatrice Venezi, the director of orchestra beloved by the right-wing, as reported today by Repubblica. According to sources from the Senate, Sangiuliano has been pressing for this intervention due to the satirical nature of Raffaele's imitation, which he sees as a threat to Italy's cultural identity and reputation abroad.

The commissioners of culture at the Chamber and Senate, Antonio Caso and Luca Pirondini, have also expressed their concerns on the matter. They called on Sangiuliano to clarify whether there was any pressure exerted on Rai for this issue.

In response, Barbara Floridia, president of the commission overseeing RAI's operation, stated that pressures from politicians on public institutions were unacceptable, especially when directed at limiting freedom of satire. She expressed solidarity with Virginia Raffaele and hoped that Sangiuliano would reverse his position.

However, a source from Rai confirmed that no such pressure had been exerted by the minister of culture against Raffaele. They stated that it was simply an imitation made in jest during one of her shows.</p>
