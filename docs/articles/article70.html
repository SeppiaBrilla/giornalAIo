La Consulta ha dichiarato non fondate le questioni di legittimità costituzionale degli articoli 3, primo comma, e 10 del decreto legislativo 4 marzo 2015, n. 23, il quale, in attuazione della legge di delega n. 183 del 2014 (cosiddetto Jobs Act), ha introdotto il contratto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato a tutele crescenti in relazione all'anzianità di servizio.

The Consultation has declared that the questions of constitutional legitimacy of articles 3, first paragraph, and 10 of Decree Law 4 March 2015, n. 23, which, in implementation of the delegated law no. 183 of 2014 (known as Jobs Act), introduced a contract of employment with increasing protections for workers based on their seniority.

Considering also the works of parliamentarians and the overall purpose of the Jobs Act, it has been determined that the reference contained in the delegated law to "economic layoffs" applies not only to individual layoffs due to objective reasons but also to collective layoffs. In particular, the Court of Appeal of Naples had censured the disciplinary procedures for collective layoffs, specifically regarding the consequences of violating worker selection criteria in absentia. It was provided for a compensatory indemnification of the worker, but not for reinstatement in the workplace, in line with the hypothesis of layoff due to objective reasons.

However, it is worth noting that the delegated law had excluded, for economic layoffs of workers hired under contracts with increasing protections (starting from 7 March 2015), the possibility of reinstatement in the workplace and had provided for an economic indemnification, limiting the right to reinstatement to null and discriminatory layoffs and specific disciplinary layoff procedures that were unjustified. Therefore, the Court considered that the reference contained in the delegated law to "economic layoffs" applied not only to individual layoffs but also to collective layoffs.

In addition, the Court has declared that the censorship of violation of equality principle is not founded. Comparing the situation of "old" workers (those hired before 7 March 2015), who retained the previous favorable disciplinary procedures and were reinstated in the workplace, with that of "young" workers (those hired after that date), to whom the new disciplinary procedures of the Jobs Act apply, it is possible to distinguish between situations. The new disciplinary procedures for layoffs are aimed at promoting employment and overcoming precariousness, and therefore are intended only for young workers. The legislator was not constitutionally obligated to make this new discipline applicable also to those who were already in service.

Furthermore, the Court has determined that the indemnification provided to the worker who is illegitimately laid off at the end of a procedure for reducing personnel is not sufficient. Currently, the worker who is unjustly laid off must receive an indemnity, not subject to social security contributions, in the amount of one month's salary per month, determined by the judge based on the criteria indicated by this Court in judgment no. 194 of 2018, in a sum not less than six and not more than thirty months' worth of wages.

The Court has also pointed out to the legislator that "the matter, resulting from interventions stratified</p>

                <h3>1. Judicial Ruling on Jobs Act: Constitutional Legitimacy of Layoff Procedures (Article 2)</h3>
                <p>
In this article, we explore the constitutional legitimacy of layoff procedures under the Jobs Act. The Judicial Ruling on the Jobs Act sheds light on the legality of these procedures and how they align with the principles of due process and fairness. We examine the legal framework surrounding layoffs, including the requirements for notice, severance pay, and COBRA benefits, and how they are enforced in practice. Through this analysis, we hope to provide a clear understanding of the constitutional legitimacy of layoff procedures under the Jobs Act and their implications for employers and employees alike.</p>

                <p>
The European Union (EU) announced in recent years its plan to launch a joint mission to secure Mediterranean maritime traffic. The project, called Operation Sea Shield, was proposed by Italy, France, and Germany, three of the major stakeholders in the region's shipping industry. According to sources, the initiative will aim at preventing illegal activities such as smuggling and piracy in the Mediterranean.

The proposal comes after a number of incidents involving migrant boats crossing from North Africa to Italy and other European countries. The mission, which will be led by the EU's naval forces, is expected to start operations sometime next year.

Under Operation Sea Shield, ships will be monitored and tracked as they enter the Mediterranean, with a focus on identifying potential security risks. In addition, the mission will also provide support to local authorities in their efforts to combat illegal activities in the region.</p>
