            <p>
An Italian court has raised a new constitutional legitimacy issue regarding assisted suicide. The article 580 of the penal code requires that non-punishability for assisting suicide is dependent on the condition of being "held alive by vital support treatments." This contrasts with articles 2, 3, 13, 32, and 117 of the constitution.

In the trial of Marco Cappato, Felicetta Maltese, and Chiara Lalli for aiding Massimiliano, a 44-year-old Tuscan man with multiple sclerosis who died by assisted suicide in Switzerland, it was noted that one of the conditions for non-punishability was "being held alive by vital support treatments." This was not met in this case, as Massimiliano had stated that he did not depend on vital support treatments, one of the four conditions set out in a notable decision from the Constitutional Court 242/2019 regarding the case of DJ Fabo.

The court ruled that this new constitutional legitimacy issue would be referred to the Consulta, a constitutional review body, for further examination. This decision highlights the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding assisted suicide in Italy, where it is still considered illegal under most circumstances.</p>

Italian Court Raises Assisted Suicide Constitutional Issue in Marco Cappato Trial
==============================================================================

On February 28, the Italian court heard oral arguments in the trial of Marco Cappato, a man who was charged with assisting suicide. During the trial, Cappato argued that his actions were within the bounds of Italy's law, which allows for assisted suicide under certain conditions. The court, however, raised a constitutional issue, questioning whether the law is consistent with the Italian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the legalization of assisted suicide in Italy.</p>
