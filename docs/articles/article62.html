Gigi Riva, the legendary soccer player and former captain of Cagliari and Italy's national team, is facing a minor heart operation at the Brotzu Hospital in Cagliari. The symptoms started on Sunday and he was rushed to the emergency room at the Pronto Soccorso in Cagliari. Doctors have placed him in the cardiology department for further evaluation and treatment.

Riva's family and close friends, including his nephew Rombo di Tuono, are optimistic that a small procedure will resolve the issue. The news of his condition has been met with concern by Riva's fans who have taken to social media to express their support. They have posted messages saying "Forza Gigi" on various platforms.

Riva is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. He holds the record for most goals scored in Italian national team history, with 35 goals to his name. In 1970, he played a key role in leading Cagliari to their only Scudetto win.

Riva is now the president of honor for the Cagliari soccer club and has turned 79 this past November. Despite his age, he remains active in the world of soccer, attending games and supporting his beloved team.

As Riva undergoes his heart operation, fans and friends alike wish him a quick recovery and continued success in the years to come.</p>

Italian Court Raises Assisted Suicide Constitutional Issue in Marco Cappato Trial
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the recent trial of Marco Cappato, an Italian activist who assisted in the suicide of his partner, a constitutional issue was raised concerning assisted suicide. The court ruled that the act of assisting in a suicide is not a criminal offense but raises questions about the constitutionality of Italy's laws against euthanasia. This decision is significant as it marks a step towards recognizing individual rights to control their own deaths, despite strong opposition from religious and conservative groups.</p>
