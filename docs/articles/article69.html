The Day of Remembrance: A Call to Vigilance

On January 27, we will remember the millions of innocent people who were killed during the Holocaust. This day, known as the Day of Remembrance, is a solemn occasion for us all to pay tribute to the victims of this horrific event.

In his opening remarks at an event in Rome, President of the Italian Chamber Lorenzo Fontana emphasized the importance of remembering the Holocaust and its lessons for today's world. He noted that the Day of Remembrance serves as a reminder that freedom and democracy must never be taken for granted. Instead, they must be actively fought for and defended every day.

"The Holocaust is an event that has no parallels in human history," said Fontana. "It was a systematic genocide organized by a specific and determined ideology of death based on the myth of race and blood."

Fontana highlighted the bravery and selflessness of those who risked their own lives to save others, including military personnel and police officers who hid Jews and helped them escape persecution. He noted that these individuals, known as "Giusti dell'Olocausto" (Justices of the Holocaust), were true heroes whose actions continue to inspire us today.

In honor of the Day of Remembrance, the Italian Chamber is hosting an event featuring a concert by the Orchestra and Chorus of Voices Bianche at the Accademia Teatro alla Scala in Milan. The performance will feature testimonies and stories from some of the many "Giusti" who risked their lives to save others during the Holocaust.

As we remember the victims of this terrible event, let us also pledge to continue fighting for freedom and democracy every day. We must never forget the lessons of the past so that we can create a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come.</p>
