            <p>
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has expressed confidence in the Italian judiciary and his desire for justice, following the accusations made against him by Premier Giorgia Meloni. Conte was summoned to appear before the Court of Honor on Monday for the 33rd time in the Republic's history, after being accused of approving changes to the Italian financial system without consulting parliament or informing the public.

During his appearance at Palazzo Madama, Conte presented a detailed account of his role in the implementation of the financial sector reform (Mes), which he claimed had been agreed upon in consultation with MPs and was necessary for Italy's economic stability. He also presented evidence to refute Meloni's claims that the change had been made without proper consultation.

The Court of Honor is a parliamentary institution tasked with investigating allegations of abuse of power by high-ranking officials, including members of government. Its proceedings are confidential, but Conte has stated that he is confident in its ability to provide justice and clear up any confusion surrounding his actions.</p>
