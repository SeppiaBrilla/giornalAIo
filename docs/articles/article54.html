In Ravenna, the diocesan office of education has decided to promote a better understanding of religion in schools by sending a letter to parents and creating short videos on social media. The idea was proposed by Simona Scala, who has been the director of the Ufficio scolastico diocesano for only a few months.

According to a recent interview with Qn-Resto del Carlino, Vescovo Lorenzo Ghizzoni explained that the hour of religion is not just catechism lessons taught by a catechist. Instead, it is an opportunity for personal growth and critical thinking about the world we live in. It also helps students understand other subjects better, as there are many connections with other disciplines.

The vescovo emphasized that religion should be seen in its cultural dimension, rather than just focusing on religious dogma. He believed that promoting this idea through short videos on social media was a great way to reach out to parents and students alike.

Scala explained that the idea of using social media to promote religion came from her own personal experience as an educator. She saw the potential for social media to reach a wider audience than traditional means, such as letters sent home with students.

The letter to parents was sent out recently, and it outlined the importance of the hour of religion in the school curriculum. It emphasized that this class was not just about learning religious doctrine, but about developing critical thinking skills, cultural awareness, and an appreciation for diversity.

The videos on social media are designed to be short and engaging, with topics such as "Why is there evil in the world?" and "What does it mean to have faith?" They will be shared on the diocesan office of education's social media channels and are aimed at parents, students, and anyone interested in learning more about religion.

Scala hopes that these videos will spark conversations about religion and encourage people to think critically about their beliefs. She believes that by promoting religious literacy, we can create a more understanding and tolerant society.

In conclusion, the decision to promote religious literacy through social media is an innovative approach that has the potential to make a significant impact on how students view religion and its role in society. The diocesan office of education's commitment to promoting this message is a step towards creating a more inclusive and respectful world.</p>
