Mitsuko Tottori, a 59 years old, has been appointed as the new president of Japan Airlines (JAL), becoming the first woman to hold this position. This marks a significant milestone in Japanese corporate culture, where women have historically been underrepresented in leadership positions.

Tottori's journey with JAL began in 1985 when she started working as a hostess. Over the years, she has held various roles within the company and has now become the first woman to reach the top spot at JAL. She will succeed Yuji Akasaka on April 1st, 2023.

The appointment of Tottori comes amid a growing trend towards greater diversity and inclusion in corporate leadership positions. However, Japan still lags behind many other countries when it comes to gender parity in the workplace. In 2022, only 15.5% of executive positions in Japanese listed companies were held by women.

Tottori's appointment is a positive step towards promoting greater diversity and representation in corporate leadership roles. It sends a clear message that women are just as capable and qualified as men to hold top positions within major corporations. As Japan continues to evolve its corporate culture, it will be interesting to see how this trend unfolds in the future.</p>
