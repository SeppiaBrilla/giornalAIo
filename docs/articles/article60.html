Chiara Ferragni, an Italian influencer, has been charged with aggravated fraud in Milan by Prosecutor Eugenio Fusco. The charges stem from three separate incidents: the 'Pink Christmas' pandoro produced by Balocco, a Piedmontese bakery, the Easter eggs made by Dolci Preziosi, and a doll called Trudi. The decision to charge Ferragni was made after an investigation by the Milanese Prosecutor's Office.

Ferragni has responded to the charges by appearing in court with legal representatives from the production companies. The case of Ferragni is just one example of how influencers are becoming increasingly scrutinized for their business practices. The new rules on transparency and advertising have been implemented by the Autorit√† di Comunicazione Audiovisiva (Agcom) in order to prevent any further incidents from occurring.

The Agcom's move comes as a result of growing concern over the lack of transparency and accountability in the influencer industry. The new rules aim to increase the visibility of sponsored content, making it clear to consumers which products are endorsed by influencers. This will help prevent any misleading or false advertising and ensure that influencers are held accountable for their actions.

The case of Ferragni is a stark reminder that businesses, including those in the food industry, need to be transparent and accountable for their actions. The incident has also brought attention to the need for greater oversight of the influencer industry and the need for stricter regulations to protect consumers from fraudulent practices.

As the world becomes increasingly digital, it's important that businesses operate with integrity and honesty, especially when it comes to advertising and marketing. The case of Ferragni serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of engaging in unethical business practices.</p>
