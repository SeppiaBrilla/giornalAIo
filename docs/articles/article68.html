Italy, France, and Germany are proposing a joint mission to secure maritime traffic in the Mediterranean. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Tajani, the mission could also include the protection of Italian ships in the Red Sea. The aim is to ensure that the ships can travel safely without the threat of drone or missile attacks from Yemen.

Tajani explained that Italy has a responsibility to protect its merchant ships and that it will do so regardless of what other countries may say. He also added that the use of force to defend these ships would be necessary if needed, but it is not the main goal of the mission. The focus is on protecting the ships and their cargo without involving in any military action.

The Italian government has already informed the parliament about its intentions and will continue to do so. Tajani also stated that the use of force to defend merchant ships would be necessary if needed but it is not the main goal of the mission. The focus is on protecting the ships and their cargo without involving in any military action.

The mission will involve a strong defense system, including the ability to shoot down drones and missiles. Tajani believes that this will ensure the safety of merchant ships traveling through the Mediterranean. He also emphasized that this mission will not involve any aggressive actions towards Yemen or other countries.

Overall, the Italian government is committed to protecting its merchant ships and ensuring safe maritime traffic in the Mediterranean. It is working closely with France and Germany to achieve this goal and will continue to keep the parliament informed about its progress.</p>

2. European Countries Warn Against Threat to Traditional Agriculture from Lab-Grown Meat

In recent years, lab-grown meat has become increasingly popular as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional meat production. However, some European countries have warned against the potential threat that this new technology could pose to traditional agriculture.

According to a report by the European Commission, lab-grown meat is currently being developed in several countries around the world, including the United States, China, and Japan. While proponents argue that it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water usage compared to conventional livestock production, critics worry about the long-term effects on rural communities and local ecosystems.

Many European countries have expressed concerns that lab-grown meat could lead to the concentration of industrial agriculture in a few large cities, leaving rural areas with fewer job opportunities and declining populations. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential environmental impacts of producing large quantities of lab-grown meat, such as increased energy consumption and waste generation.

The European Commission has called on member states to consider the potential impact of lab-grown meat on traditional agriculture and rural communities when developing policies related to this emerging technology. Some countries have already implemented regulations or restrictions on the production and sale of lab-grown meat, while others are still considering their options.</p>
