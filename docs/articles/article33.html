On Wednesday, an horrific accident occurred during the opening day of Motor Bike Expo, a world-renowned motorcycle fair held at the Fiera di Verona in Italy. The accident happened at 13:30, when a stuntman driving a BMW lost control of his vehicle and crashed into the barriers surrounding the area, injuring 14 people.

The video of the incident has been widely circulated on social media, and it is clear that the stuntman was performing a "derapate" (a dangerous maneuver in which a driver swerves dangerously in and out of traffic), while in the area where spectators were gathered. The stuntman's actions led to his loss of control over the vehicle, which crashed into the barriers, injuring 14 people, including three with minor injuries and six who required immediate medical attention.

Veronafiere, the organizer of the fair, has stated that the accident occurred during one of the dynamic shows featuring professional stuntmen. The show involved BMWs and other vehicles in a dangerous display. Veronafiere expressed their deepest regrets for what happened and thanked the spectators for their cooperation during the incident. They also emphasized the importance of safety measures, stating that "thanks to the barrier, no one was seriously injured."

Following the accident, all shows in the outdoor areas were immediately suspended. Motor Bike Expo, which is celebrating its 30th edition, is being held at the Fiera di Verona until Sunday, January 21, covering an area of 100,000 square meters and featuring 700 exhibitors and six outdoor areas reserved for races, shows, and demonstrations.</p>
