As we approach the winter season, it's important to be aware of the potential dangers posed by cold temperatures on our bodies. Recent research from Harvard Medical School and Northeastern University, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, has shown that a drop of just 5 degrees Celsius in the internal temperature of nasal tissues can significantly reduce the effectiveness of our body's first line of defense against viruses and bacteria.

According to Dr. Francesco Landi, past president of the Society of Italian Gerontology and Geriatrics (Sigg), this is because the mucous membranes in our nose release billions of tiny sacs filled with fluid called vescicule extracellulari that surround and attack foreign substances before they can enter our bodies. However, even a slight reduction in the internal temperature of these mucous membranes can render this protective mechanism useless, leading to a decrease in the effectiveness of our first line of defense against viruses and bacteria.

This is particularly concerning for older individuals who are more vulnerable to colds and flu, as well as those with lower levels of vaccine coverage or who have not fully recovered from a previous illness. As Dr. Andrea Ungar, president of Sigg and an ordinal professor of geriatrics at the University of Florence, explains, "For older individuals, especially those who are already exposed to high risk factors such as low immune function, vaccination is crucial in protecting them from infections. It's also important to protect the nose by wearing appropriate clothing, such as scarves and masks, to maintain a higher temperature in the mucous membranes."

In addition to vaccination and proper clothing, maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise can also help support our immune system and improve overall health during the winter months. As Dr. Landi emphasizes, "It's important to note that integrators should be recommended by your own doctor based on your individual needs and health status."

As we navigate the upcoming cold weather season, it's important to prioritize our health and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves from illness and infection.</p>
