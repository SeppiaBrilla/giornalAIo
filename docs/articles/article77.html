Italy is facing its first transport strike of 2024, as announced by the trade unions Cobas Lavoro Privato, Cub Trasporti, Usb, Adl, Sgb, Associazioni lavoratori Cobas and Orsa. The words "salario, sicurezza e diritti" (salary, safety, and rights) have been the rallying cry for this national strike of autoferrotranvieri, which highlights the demands of the trade unions.

During the 24-hour strike, the service will be guaranteed within the legal hours: from the start of the morning shift at 8:29 am to 7 pm. The union leaders have emphasized that this is not just a local strike, but a national one, which affects all modes of public transport, including buses, trams, and metro.

The main objective of the strike is to demand better working conditions and wages for the workers in the sector. The unions have been calling for negotiations with the authorities and employers to address their demands, but so far, there has been no response from the government or the companies.

As a result, the trade unions have decided to take direct action by organizing this national strike. They are demanding that the government intervene in the sector and guarantee decent wages and working conditions for all workers.

The union leaders have emphasized that this is not just an industrial action but also a political one, as it highlights the need for greater investment in public transport and the recognition of the fundamental rights of workers. They are calling on all citizens to support their cause by staying away from using public transport during the strike hours.

The strike has been met with mixed reactions across Italy, with some supporting the workers' demands and others criticizing them for causing inconvenience to commuters. However, it is clear that this national strike represents a significant moment in Italian labor history and will have far-reaching consequences for the future of public transport in the country.

The union leaders have emphasized that they are not looking for a confrontational approach but are willing to negotiate with the government and employers to find a solution that benefits both workers and citizens. However, they have also warned that if their demands are not met, they will continue to organize more strikes in the future.

As Italy prepares for its first transport strike of 2024, it remains to be seen what the outcome will be and how it will affect the future of public transport in the country. However, one thing is certain: the workers in the sector are demanding better working conditions and wages, and they are not willing to back down until their demands are met.</p>
