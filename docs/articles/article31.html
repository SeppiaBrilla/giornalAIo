Climate change has been a topic of concern for years now, with many experts warning of its severe impact on the health and well-being of people around the world. A new study conducted by Amit Roy, a professor of economics and public policies at The New School in New York City, has shed light on the potential consequences of climate change, including a reduction in life expectancy.

According to Roy's research, published in the journal Plos Climate, an increase of just one degree Celsius in global temperatures can lead to a five-month reduction in life expectancy. Moreover, a 10-point increase in an index that combines temperature and precipitation data can result in a six-month reduction in life expectancy.

The study analyzed data from 191 countries worldwide between 1940 and 2020, taking into account variables such as average temperatures, rainfall, and gross domestic product per capita to control for differences between countries. The results were clear: climate change is having a direct impact on human health, with increased temperatures and precipitation leading to an increased risk of respiratory and mental illnesses, as well as heat-related illnesses and drowning in floods.

The study also found that women and people living in developing countries are most at risk from the negative effects of climate change. This highlights the urgent need for global action to address this crisis, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing policies to protect vulnerable populations, and investing in healthcare systems to better prepare for the health impacts of climate change.

As Roy notes, "The global threat posed by climate change to the well-being of billions of people highlights the urgent need to treat this as a public health crisis. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and implementing proactive measures are essential to protect the health and lives of populations around the world."</p>
