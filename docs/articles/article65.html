Italian authorities are currently investigating the deaths of a 63-year-old man and his 43-year-old wife, both of whom were found dead in an apartment in Agropoli, Italy. The victims, who were identified as a pizzaiolo and a bank employee respectively, are believed to have been killed with a knife, and their bodies were discovered by the daughter who had been sleeping in the same apartment.

The initial investigation suggests that the man killed his wife, then turned the knife on himself. However, this is only speculation as the medical examiner has not yet determined the exact cause of death. The police are currently collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses to confirm the details of what happened.

According to eyewitness accounts, the woman's mother noticed that her daughter was not answering the phone, so she called the police. When the officers arrived, they found the couple dead in their apartment. It is unclear if there were any signs of a struggle or forced entry at the scene of the crime.

The local community is shocked by the tragic incident and is offering their condolences to the victims' families. The police are working diligently to determine what led to this terrible outcome and bring the perpetrator to justice.</p>
