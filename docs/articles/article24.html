The discovery of Covid-19, the deadly virus that has taken the world by storm, is attributed to a team of Chinese researchers who isolated and mapped the disease in December 2019. This was revealed exclusively by the Wall Street Journal after examining documents provided by the US Department of Health.

The Chinese researcher Li Ling Ren from the Institute of Pathogen Biology in Beijing had already sequenced the virus before the Chinese government publicly announced the outbreak to be a mysterious pneumonia caused by an unknown cause and ordered the closure of the local live animal market, where the first cases were detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) only received the sequencing information from China on January 11th, 2020.

The new information reveals that the world does not yet have a complete explanation for the origin of the pandemic. However, it suggests that the virus may have been transmitted from animals to humans rather than from a laboratory accident or a natural occurrence.

The two weeks leading up to the revelation could have been crucial in helping the international medical community understand the spread of the disease, develop defensive measures and initiate a vaccine. Scientists and governments around the world were racing to comprehend the mysterious illness that would later be named Covid-19 and kill millions of people.

In conclusion, the discovery of the Covid-19 virus by Chinese researchers was a significant breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. While there is still much to learn about its origin and spread, this new information sheds light on the importance of quick action and collaboration in the global response to a public health crisis.</p>
