Amazon has announced the development of a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence to assist customers in their purchases. According to Cnbc, this was revealed through an internal source, who provided some details on the tool. The chatbot is intended to help customers make specific product queries without having to read all the reviews related to those products. For example, users could ask the AI to summarize the pros and cons of a particular item in order to determine if it meets their needs.

Amazon has already launched a new menu that allows vendors to use artificial intelligence generative technology to create product descriptions. However, this has also led to problems with text formulation in the United States, where phrases such as "I can't follow this request" or "This is against OpenAI's policies" may appear when the ChatGpt-based functionality is used and given complete freedom of expression. The chatbot in development would instead use internal algorithms from Amazon to provide more accurate and reliable assistance to customers.

In addition, Amazon Web Services can be used for advanced technological solutions available on the cloud. The CEO of the company, Andy Jassy, has stated that the company is using artificial intelligence generative technology to organize its warehouses and advise vendors on the best delivery routes for each order. According to him, this will improve the customer experience and make their work more efficient.

The chatbot in development by Amazon shows great potential for revolutionizing the e-commerce industry. It is expected to be a game changer for both customers and vendors alike, as it will enable more accurate and efficient communication between them. With the use of artificial intelligence generative technology, it is likely that we will see a significant improvement in the way businesses operate in the online space.</p>

                <h3>4. Combining Immunotherapy and Chemioembolization Improves Outcome for Patients with Liver Cancer</h3>
                <p>
Liver cancer is a serious health concern that often leads to liver failure. However, a recent study found that combining immunotherapy and chemioembolization can improve outcomes for patients with this type of cancer. Immunotherapy stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells, while chemioembolization blocks blood flow to tumors and delivers chemotherapy directly to them. The combination therapy was shown to increase the efficacy of treatment and reduce side effects compared to either therapy alone. Overall, this research suggests that combining immunotherapy and chemioembolization may be an effective treatment option for liver cancer patients.</p>
