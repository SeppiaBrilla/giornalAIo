Pakistan and Iran have agreed to a "de-escalation" following the recent exchange of attacks between the two countries. This was announced by Pakistani Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

During their discussion, the two ministers also discussed the return of ambassadors to the capital cities of both countries. The Pakistani government reminded in a statement that the relationship between the two countries is fraternal and urged them to work together on the basis of mutual trust and cooperation. Jilani emphasized that respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty should be the foundation of this cooperation.

The two foreign ministers agreed that operational-level cooperation and close coordination on issues such as terrorism and shared interests should be strengthened. Iranian Ambassador to Islamabad Syed Rasoul Mousavi stated in a televised interview that the two ministers had a positive telephone conversation with the aim of restoring relations to a higher level.

On January 17, following attacks by Iranian aircraft against suspected hideouts of Jaish al-Adl inside Pakistani territory, Islamabad recalled its ambassador from Teheran and requested that the visiting Iranian ambassador in Pakistan not return. The following day, Pakistani forces launched seven attacks on Iranian soil targeting separatist groups.

It is hoped that this de-escalation agreement will lead to a normalization of relations between Pakistan and Iran, which have had a history of tension due to their differing ideologies and geopolitical interests.</p>
