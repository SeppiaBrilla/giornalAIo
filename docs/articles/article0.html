Climate change is causing a decline in the number of spots on butterflies. Species that develop at higher temperatures have fewer spots, likely to better blend in with dry, brown vegetation commonly found in warmer environments. A study by researchers at the University of Exeter published in the journal Ecology and Evolution has shed light on the long-standing debate about the reasons for changes in butterfly spot patterns.

The research team, led by Richard ffrench-Constant, focused specifically on the Maniola jurtina species, which is found throughout Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. This species is known for its large spots, called "ocelli," on the upper wings that scare away predators and smaller spots on the lower wings that may help it blend in when resting.

According to ffrench-Constant, the team's findings suggest that butterflies are adapting their mimetism based on environmental conditions. For example, with fewer spots, it may be harder for a butterfly to blend in with dry, brown vegetation. However, the same effect was not observed in male butterflies, whose spots may be important for attracting partners.

This unexpected consequence of climate change suggests that butterfly species may need to migrate north to escape its effects, as changing environmental conditions make it difficult for them to adapt.</p>
